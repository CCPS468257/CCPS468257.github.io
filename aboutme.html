  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm working towards being a better student and overall person. This is because despite how great anyone can be, there is always room for improvement. I've learned this from observing some others' behaviors, and looking back at my own.
I am working towards this by trying to be more open with my schedule, My comfort zone is being in a certain routine, and I'm working on becoming more flexible to sudden changes. I am also working towards learning more life skills, such as tolerating and time management.
I value trust and transparency. This is because both help present yourself as an honest, trustworthy person. With this, I will be able to be more collaborative in whatever work environment I find myself in.
I hope to accomplish getting my learner's permit before summer break. I also want to improve my fluency in Spanish. Lastly, I would like to better my general life skills.
I want to be known for being strategic person who can come up with different solutions to problems. I can think in and outside the box, and can provide unique perspectives to different situations. What I lack in social skills, I make up for with my creativity.</p>
